## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions

## Requirements

### 29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object! <a name='subparagraph29'></a>

Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):

* introduction
* id and type
* mutable objects
* immutable objects
* why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects
* how arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects

<em>If you worked on advanced tasks, please also include what you did learn in those tasks in the blog post.</em>

Your posts should have many code/output examples to illustrate what you are explaining, and at least one picture, at the top.
Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, LinkedIn post, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
